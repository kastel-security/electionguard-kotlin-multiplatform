Every step of verification that applies to traditional ElectionGuard ballots also applies to pre-
encrypted ballots – with the exception of the process for computing confirmation codes. However,
52there are some additional verification steps that must be applied to pre-encrypted ballots. Specifi-
cally, the following verifications should be done for every pre-encrypted cast ballot contained in the
election record.
    • The ballot confirmation code correctly matches the hash of all contest hashes on the ballot
    (listed sequentially).
    • Each contest hash correctly matches the hash of all selection hashes (including null selection
    hashes) within that contest (sorted within each contest).
    • All short codes shown to voters are correctly computed from selection hashes in the election
    record which are, in turn, correctly computed from the pre-encryption vectors published in
    the election record.
    • For contests with selection limit greater than 1, the selection vectors published in the election
    record match the product of the pre-encryptions associated with the short codes listed as
    selected.
The following verifications should be done for every pre-encrypted ballot listed in the election
record as uncast.
    • The ballot confirmation code correctly matches the hash of all contest hashes on the ballot
    (listed sequentially).
    • Each contest hash correctly matches the hash of all selection hashes (including null selection
    hashes) within that contest (sorted within each contest).
    • All short codes on the ballot are correctly computed from the selection hashes in the election
    record which are, in turn, correctly computed from the pre-encryption vectors published in
    the election record.
    • The decryptions of all pre-encryptions correspond to the plaintext values indicated in the
    election manifest.

// Verification 18 (Validation of short codes in pre-encrypted ballots)
// An election verifier must confirm for every selectable option on every pre-encrypted ballot in the
//   election record that the short code ω displayed with the selectable option satisfies
//     (18.A) ω = Ω(ψ) where ψ is the selection hash associated with the selectable option.
//   Specifically, for cast ballots, this includes all short codes that are published in the election record
//   whose associated selection hashes correspond to selection vectors that are accumulated to form
//   tallies. For spoiled ballots, this includes all selection vectors on the ballot.
//    (18.B)  An election verifier must also confirm that for contests with selection limit greater than 1,
//   the selection vectors published in the election record match the product of the pre-encryptions associated
//   with the short codes listed as selected.

//    hash ψi satisfies ψi = H(HE ; 0x40, K, α1 , β1 , α2 , β2 , . . . , αm , βm ).
//  (17.B) The contest hash χl for the contest with context index l for all 1 ≤ l ≤ mB has been
//    correctly computed from the selection hashes ψi as
//    χl = H(HE ; 0x41, l, K, ψσ(1) , ψσ(2) , . . . , ψσ(m+L) ),
//    where σ is a permutation and ψσ(1) < ψσ(2) < · · · < ψσ(m+L) .
//  (17.C) The ballot confirmation code H(B) has been correctly computed from the (sequentially
//    ordered) contest hashes and if specified in the election manifest file from the additional byte
//    array Baux as H(B) = H(HE ; 0x42, χ1 , χ2 , . . . , χmB , Baux ).
//  (17.D) There are no duplicate confirmation codes, i.e. among the set of submitted (cast and chal-
//    lenged) ballots, no two have the same confirmation code.
